### Abstract

China has experienced rapid urban expansion in the past three decades. While the process of urbanization occurred during the early stages favored large cities, the course of spatial transformation, the narrative of infrastructure development, and the provisions of resource consumption provided opportunities for smaller cities to grow faster. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic urban growth patterns and investigate key driving forces of land expansion in Jiaxing, China, a small city with rising economic power. We apply two simulation models, the SLEUTH Cellular Automata (CA) model and the Machine Learning (ML) model, to test planning policies-informed urban growth scenarios from 2021 to 2040. We then perform spatiotemporal analytics to identify patterns of urban transformation under different scenarios, such as environmental protection, policy-induced interprovincial migration, and transformation of polycentric form. We evaluate the sensitivity of policy intervention through spatial and temporal comparisons. Our hypothesis is that urban planning policies have diverse spatial sensitivity on urban growth. For example, the environmental policy generates new urban growth areas in locations different from the migration policy. Moreover, policies have diverse temporal sensitivity on urban growth. For example, the polycentric policy can induce rapid increase of total population in the early stage (first 6-7 years) of prediction. Furthermore, policies that produce more immediate impacts (migration and polycentric) also result in various spatial patterns of urban growth. The paper contributes to the existing studies of urban growth modeling in the following ways: (1) Providing a robust assessment using more recent data; (2) Comparing results from the SLEUTH CA and the ML model; (3) focusing on a less studied small city with policy informed scenarios. Even though the study area is in China, we aim to offer opportunities for knowledge exchange in small cities around the globe.
