### Abstract

In the early stage, China’s urbanization policy favored large cities. However, recent policy changes provided more development opportunities for smaller cities. In this paper, we analyzed the dynamic urban growth patterns and investigate key driving forces of land expansion in Jiaxing, China, a small city with rising economic power. We applied two urban growth models, namely, a machine-learning-based model (ML) and a SLEUTH Cellular Automata (CA) model, to test planning policies–informed urban growth scenarios from 2021 to 2040. Then, spatial-temporal analytics were performed to identify patterns of urban transformation under different scenarios. We chose water protection scenarios with 100-500 m buffer zones to reflect the environmental characteristics of Jiaxing. The results show that an urban policy with a 400 m water protection area demonstrates the strongest alignment with the goal of future urban growth of Jiaxing. From the temporal dimension, the turning point of the land loss change rate also varies by models as well as scenarios. Moreover, consideration of the grandfather clause can make the results of the ML model more practical. The paper contributes to the existing studies of urban growth modeling in the following ways: (1) it focuses on the sustainable development of a less studied small city with water protection policy-informed scenarios; (2) it provides a robust assessment of sensitivity of water protection policy on urban growth by using more recent data; and (3) since urban developments are more likely to be affected by multiple factors, using different models representing a diverse local policy to validate each other is therefore critical to urban planners and local authorities.
